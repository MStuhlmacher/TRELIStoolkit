# What is TRELIS?

TRELIS (which stands for Training and Retaining Leaders in STEM) was a program funded by NSF Award 1660400 to support early career women in geospatial sciences. The grant funded workshops to bring together a small group of early career and established scholars to discuss and learn from each other around our shared (and unique!) challenges and opportunties. The initial grant award period has now ended, but the conversations and materials generated by the project are something we want to make available to all through this online toolkit.
