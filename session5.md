# Session 5: Mentoring and Coaching

## Overview/Summary
This session will consist of a series of whole and small-group discussions related to mentoring and coaching. Traditional ‘top-down’ mentoring has been recognized as contributing to a wide range of personal and professional benefits, including increased sense of competence, self-efficacy, personal development, promotion, higher salaries, increased mobility and career advancement and success. However, these top-down relationships require time and effort to maximize them. Additionally, it is unlikely that a singular mentor will be able to satisfy all of your mentoring needs. The ability to take ownership of your own mentoring needs and create a network of mentors is a powerful skill that will be honed by this curriculum
